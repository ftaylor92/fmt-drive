<h3>mp3 Player's Playlists</h3>
Apple iTunes/iPod playlists are created through iTunes only<br/>
Sony playlists are created by left-clicking on mp3 files while the Sony mp3 player is plugged in (on Windows)<br/>
m3u playlists can be played in <a href="http://www.rockbox.org">Rockbox</a> or Windows Media Player<br/>
You can drag your m3u playlist file onto Windows Media Player's playlist window to see all your songs<br/>
If you have .wpl playlists saved from Windows Media Player, you can convert them to m3u playlists with <a href="./wmp2rockbox.pl">this</a> Perl script<br/>
If you want to create new m3u playlists with a graphics tool, you can compile and run <a href="./PlaylistEditor.java">this</a> Java class<br/>
A m3u playlist is just a list of filePaths to mp3 files (separated by &lt;cr&gt;s)<br/>
