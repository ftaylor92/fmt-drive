<TD WIDTH="90%">Reports from Our Lady's Parishioners on their Trip to Haiti</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Black">
<P>January 4-15, 2000, 11 parishioners, from Our Lady Help of Christians, Concord Mass, went as pilgrims to Haiti under the auspices of the St. Boniface Haiti Foundation, which provides support and medical care for 40,000 people in the rural area of Fond des Blancs.  Here are some of their reflections:</P>

<B><P>Maureen Jameson</B><U>:</U>  </FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style MT It" SIZE=4>How can I write about Haiti in just a few lines?  For me it was one of those awesome, life-changing moments, and I have yet to reach the fullness or the depths of the meaning and impact on my life.  So much happened in the planning and the preparation to go, in the actual going and the coming home, and in the ongoing reflection and sharing with others.  My heart has changed.  My mind has changed.  I think and feel differently about Haiti, about myself, and about my companions.
We visited sites of past tragedies.  We witnessed unimaginable poverty and the underdevelopment of the country.  It would seem that there are few resources to meet the basic needs of human life.  We also experienced the hope, the love, and the great faith of the Haitian people, the missionaries, and of each other.
Haiti has changed my life and I could not have gone without all of you at this parish.  Thank you for your prayers and support.  I felt your presence every day</FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva">.

<B><P>John Kielty, Jr.:</B>  </FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style MT It" SIZE=4>I intellectualized the trip to Haiti. In speaking to many of the previous pilgrims, I understood the rationale for making the trip.  We would bring supplies to St. Boniface Hospital, help out where we could and take the time to visit individuals who have had a deeper involvement in Haiti's democratic and religious movements.  As it turns out, the trip had very little to do with these things.  Rather, my Haitian experience, both the good and the bad, was a personal growth opportunity like no other.  The sight, feel, sound and smell of Haiti, manifest in the people and their surroundings, proved a catalyst for joy, sorrow, hope and despair.  These feelings were so powerful that they cannot possibly be explained to anyone who has not made the same journey.  I hope that others decide to make the pilgrimage in the future, both to become closer to God and to gain a better understanding of themselves.</P>

<B><P>Don Sweet</B>:  </FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style MT It" SIZE=4>Should I contribute?  Will my money go to the needy?  These are the questions I ask myself when I receive a request from a charitable organization.  Having just come back from Haiti, I was able to see for myself the good work the St. Boniface Haiti Foundation has achieved.  Without a doubt, this is a charity where your money is going directly to aid those in need.  There is great need and hunger in Haiti.  I beg you to give generously.  God's Blessings be with you.</P>

<B><P>Jane Audrey-Neuhauser</B>:  </FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style MT It" SIZE=4>We could do so little, yet we could do so much.  In the city of Port-au-Prince, the immensity of the problems is beyond description,  I experienced a feeling of helplessness--what could I do to make a dent in the misery which we saw?  In Fond des Blancs, in contrast, the problems were of a more manageable nature; we could see the progress which resulted from previous groups and giving.  We brought medical supplies, helped with vaccination clinics, helped a struggling family, got to know people, saw the progress of the hard-working laborers building an operating room and nutrition center.  Because of all the efforts of you and the Foundation, Fond des Blancs is becoming a better place to live!</P>

<B><P>Christy Norton</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style MT It" SIZE=4>:  I can never forget what my eyes have seen or my heart has felt.  I hold a baby's emaciated body that is ravaged by TB and possible AIDS.  He clung to me with all his strength.  As I looked into his eyes I knew he had a story to tell.  This precious child will not live to see his first birthday and another child will take his place in the blood stained crib at Mother Teresa's Home for Sick Children.   It is so easy to look at problems of poverty and inequity in healthcare and become overwhelmed by their magnitude and complexity.  What can I do?  I can touch one life at a time with love and compassion.  It is love which is the greatest gift and motivator for social action.  I went to Haiti to give back and found that I received a hundred times more than I could ever give.  I was inspired by the faith and hope of the Haitian people in the presence of immense suffering and loss.  The memory of Haiti and the reality of God's presence there will stay with me always.</P>

<B><P>Mary Taylor</B>:  </FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style MT It" SIZE=4>"Look," said the missionary seated next to me on the plane leaving Miami.  "I've worked in Haiti for twenty years.  I'll tell you what it's like.  A family has, maybe, four children, and there is only a little bit to go around.  Dad's got to eat 'cuz he's the breadwinner.  And Mom has to eat 'cuz she takes care of the kids.  And then, well, you try to feed everybody, but maybe you can't so you pick two of the kids to feed and if they're lucky even see a doctor or go to school.  Groups like St. Boniface exist so parents don't have to make those agonizing choices.  Tell your people back home to pray 'cuz God is working miracles and tell them every dollar counts."</P>

<FONT FACE="Geneva"><B><P>Dennis Taylor:   </FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style MT It" SIZE=4>We went into the back country where there was woman in a single room hut with ten kids (two husbands in a row had died).  She had nothing except what her poor neighbours could spare.  She was embarrassed about inviting us into her hut. We understood later.  Haitians prize their hospitality, but she had no chair on which we could sit.  I stood by her.  I am six foot plus, and she is less than five feet tall.  I felt like I was standing next to one of the saved.  I hoped a little would rub off.</P><BR>
