<p>The Foundation began when Rev. Gerald Osterman, of St. Boniface Parish, Quincy MA, decided that his parish, though a poor one, would itself reach out to the poor of Haiti.  After a Walk for Hunger in 1982, parishioners decided to donate half of the proceeds from the &quot;walk&quot; to Mother Theresa&#146;s newly opened home for children in Port-Au-Prince, Haiti.  Told that they would have to take the money in person, parishioners travelled in 1983 with <A HREF="http://www2.bc.edu/~taylor/Getogethers/faith.html">Faith and Concern.</A>  </P>
<P>In 1984 they returned with Faith and Concern to the town of Fond des Blancs and met Father Guello, the local pastor.  In 1985, they began to work closely with the local parish, St. Francis Xavier, and made a commitment to the people of Fond des Blancs.  An immunization program was begun and a guesthouse was built in Fond des Blancs for work-retreat groups.</P>

<P>The St. Boniface Foundation then contributed to the building of St. Francis Xavier elementary school, and also started building a small dispensary in 1988.  In 1992 St. Boniface planned and built a 20-bed hospital, and invited the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul to administer the hospital.  A convent was built in 1996.  By 1997, a full medical staff was in place, with approximately 12,000 patients seen.  By 1998, the figure rose to 25,000.  Meanwhile work-retreats continued, as many as eight a year, with groups of 12-15 people, bringing medicines and supplies from the U.S.  In 1999, the construction of the Operating Room and Nutrition Center was begun, with expected completion in the summer of 2000;</P>

<P>Thanks to the support of a broad and diverse group of people, the Saint Boniface Haiti Foundation is indeed making a difference.</P></FONT>
