<TD WIDTH="90%">"Packing for Haiti"<br>Haiti desperately needs the medicine and supplies that come in your suitcases. 
Many volunteers bring two suitcases full of supplies (70 pounds per suitcase), and for their own personal use take an airline carry-on suitcase plus a carry-on bag or backpack that would fit under the seat. 
Usually these are sufficient for traveler's needs in this tropical climate. 
Stated airline regulations (see your airline ticket envelope) allow 1. three checked bags and no carry-on bag, 2. two checked bags and one carry-on bag, 3. one checked bag and two carry on bags 
Checked bag cannot exceed 70 pounds, or outside combined dimensions (length+height+width) of 62, 55 inches and 45 inches for the first, second, and third piece respectively.
Carry-on bags (maximum two, see above), canot exceed combined weight of 40 pounds, or exceed the following dimensions: valet closet, 4" x 23 1/2" x 45"; overhead, 10" x 16" x 24"; under seat, 8" x 16" x 21" 
So much for the regs. There is some ambiguity. If one checks through three 70 pound bags, presumably one could take on board a large purse, or even a back pack? In any event, to maximize the medicines they carry, seasoned pilgrims check in two 70 pound bags, and carry on a airline 'stewardess' suitcase, plus a back pack, or generous bag. 
If you have room to carry supplies, please contact Nannette Canniff or Lorrie Charpentier listed on this web page under "Board Members and Friends".
