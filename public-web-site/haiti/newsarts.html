<P ALIGN="CENTER">A Visit to Haiti</P>
<P>Haiti is 90 minutes from Miami. When you arrive, you encounter instant culture shock. The airport is noisy and chaotic. Everyone speaks at once, and no one speaks in English. What seemed like hundreds of porters helped/hurried us along to our waiting vehicle. One of the first things I noticed was the number of young men missing an arm or a leg. They had been victims of machete wielding military and henchmen of former dictators, the Duvaliers. There are no artificial limbs. This is not a place for luxuries. People adapt and make the best of things. This is only the beginning. The Haitian people&#146;s ability to adapt and make do is quite remarkable. It has been necessary for their very survival. Historically, they have been much maligned and persecuted. They now have a fledgling democracy, but the government&#146;s coffers are empty. Baby Doc took $700 million dollars with him when he left the country in 1986. He lives comfortably on the Riviera now. In Haiti, there is no welfare, no healthcare, no educational system, no water, no sanitation system, no electricity, no food, no work, and no dignity for the poor. One marvels that they can exist with so little. We visited Mother Theresa&#146;s Home for the Dying and Mother Theresa&#146;s Home for Children. There we ministered to those who were losing the battle for survival. As we drove through the capitol, we saw crowded makeshift shelters that would scarcely qualify as sheds back home. I thought of my own shed, which would be a mansion to one of these families living in one room with a dirt floor and no furniture. Everywhere we turned, there were street vendors trying to make a few dollars to feed their families. Unemployment is at 70 percent. There is no industry. People want to work, but there are no jobs. There are no stores, as we know them, even in the capitol of Port au Prince. The roads wind and turn in the worst possible condition, pavement suddenly giving way to dirt and ruts without warning. Cars are old and show evidence of repeated repairs. It is no wonder. We visited the General Hospital and found it old and rusty and completely lacking for supplies of any kind. Patients must go to dingy drugstores across the street to purchase medication and supplies for treatment. If they have no money, they may very well die of pneumonia, diarrhea, or other easily treated conditions. Through it all, the people are warm and friendly. Everyone says "Bonjour". Suicide is almost unheard of. No matter how little you have, you share it with your neighbor. </P>
<P>As we drove out to the backcountry, the countryside was parched and dry for mile after mile. It reminded me of the "old west". I learned that Haiti is an ecological disaster. A lush tropical paradise when Columbus arrived, it has been deforested for a multitude of reasons. The rains no longer come. Most of the rivers are dry. People walk miles daily to a well and carry water back in jugs for drinking and cooking. If the short rainy season does arrive, erosion and disaster come with it. So much topsoil has washed out to sea, that corals and sea life are dead for one half mile from shore. Flimsy boats are unable to navigate the distance to get to adequate fishing grounds further out. There is very little farming due to poor soil quality and lack of water. Most yards are bare without so much as a blade of grass growing. Everywhere, one sees animals---goats, chickens, donkeys, and pigs. The village of Fond des Blancs, our destination, is 75 miles from the capitol. The roads are so bad, it takes us 5 hours bouncing in the back of a Land Rover to get there. The sights overload our senses. It is difficult to believe one&#146;s eyes. A very old and very frail woman carries a load of kindling up a steep hill by the side of the road. Very young children carry jugs of water from a community well to homes that are out of sight. Countless people walk by the side of the road, many with heavy loads. The lucky ones have a donkey. It is like the family car in Haiti, but most of the poor cannot afford the $100 to buy and animal and saddle baskets. We pass open markets. Everything is bought here. The social center of society, they are like huge flea markets. Small hills of beautifully colored grains are for sale everywhere. There are many foodstuffs that I cannot identify. Clothing and shoes are used, as are most other things. I see nothing that I would want to buy.</P>
<P>Finally we arrive at our destination. There is a quaint church with a cemetery behind it. We will stay in the rectory. Rooms are dormitory style, bathrooms down the hall. Water is very scarce. We use extreme measures to conserve it. For drinking and brushing teeth, only bottled water will do. Eagerly, we inspect the hospital, Centre de Sante St. Boniface. It is clean and simple. We unpack many suitcases of medical supplies and restock the pharmacy. Here, no one is denied care. Payment may be in eggs or service of some kind, but it is always worked out. Construction on the operating room addition is going well. All building blocks, doors and frames are made on site by hand. There are no power tools here. We are amazed at what they are able to accomplish. People will come for miles to use this facility. It offers the best quality of care the poor will find anywhere in Haiti. The next day, some of us stand in the back of a pick-up truck and travel to outlying areas with the nurses to do immunization clinics. A battery-powered megaphone is used to announce our coming as we travel. The nurses sing a little song calling mothers and fathers to bring their children for immunizations. To our amazement, the system works. Many have gathered bearing a card for each child who will be weighed and immunized according to a preset schedule. They sit outside and wait patiently for their turns.</P>
<P>The next day we travel two hours to visit Fr. Marc Boisvert in Les Cayes. He is an Oblate who takes in street boys and gives them what they have never known&#151;a home and something to eat on a regular basis. To us the situation looks desperate. He has 73 boys and only 33 beds. The children trade shoes and school supplies at noontime so that all can get to school. They have nothing, and yet they have never had it so good. God bless Fr. Marc. He has his work cut out for him. There is so much more to tell. I invite you to come to the hall at St. Denis on ----and see my slides of Haiti. We have so much at St. Denis. Perhaps you will know a way to reach out to our brothers in such great need. My heartfelt thanks to all of you who supported the Operating Room Project and donated medical and school supplies for Haiti. You really DID make a difference. May God bless you. </P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>Letter to Sponsors</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</B></FONT><P>Dear Sponsors,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My visit to Haiti was an experience that I will never forget. I can assure you, the two families that we sponsor are in great need. We are truly making a difference in their lives. </P>
<P>Our first family is Jeannine Lajoie and her six children. The last, a boy, was born after my return. They live in a rather dilapidated house with a dirt floor, no plumbing, and no electricity. The children are:</P>
<P>Natasha&#9;&#9;girl &#9;age 15</P>
<P>Fuirlande&#9;&#9;girl&#9;age 13</P>
<P>Gener&#9;&#9;&#9;boy&#9;age 9</P>
<P>Ulesner&#9;&#9;boy&#9;age 7</P>
<P>Samanta&#9;&#9;girl&#9;age 3</P>
<P>Jean Pierre&#9;&#9;boy&#9;age newborn</P>
<P>Several months ago, a son, Naderge, age 6,became ill and died. Such occurrences are not unusual in Haiti. I regret I have no further details to give you.</P>
<P>All but the youngest two attend school thanks to your generosity. Since we have begun sponsoring her, she has been able to purchase 2 more beds and some kitchen utensils. She proudly showed them to me. </P>
<P>When I arrived in Fond des Blancs, Jeannine sent her daughter to bring me a gift of eggs and a large papaya. Hospitality is very important to the Haitian people. They are very generous with whatever they have. They always share with their neighbors. </P>
<P>Jeannine has begun stockpiling supplies for a new house. All work is done by hand. Building blocks are made on site. Nothing happens quickly in Haiti. The family also has chickens and a goat. </P>
<P>On Sunday, the entire family was in church looking their very best. They were so very warm and friendly and happy to meet me. I gave them greetings from all of you. I brought them towels, sheets, and a few clothes. I also sent some things for the baby with the next retreat group. Their lives are much better since we began helping them.</P>
<P>My hardest day in Haiti was the day we visited Madame Celaine Ennade and her 11 children. She and her children are our second family. They are:</P>
<P>Simone&#9;&#9;girl&#9;age 27 &amp; her baby (Simone&#146;s husband was murdered </P>
<P>Girard&#9;&#9;&#9;boy&#9;age 22 when her baby was 15 days old.) </P>
<P>Roseleine&#9;&#9;girl&#9;age 20</P>
<P>Duval Julner&#9;&#9;boy&#9;age 19</P>
<P>Benis&#9;&#9;&#9;boy&#9;age 16</P>
<P>Marcel&#9;&#9;            boy&#9;age 12</P>
<P>Remy Duval&#9;&#9;boy&#9;age 10</P>
<P>Gito Duval&#9;&#9;boy&#9;age 8</P>
<P>Jean Jules&#9;&#9;boy&#9;age 7</P>
<P>Wilson&#9;&#9;            boy&#9;age 5 </P>
<P>Bartholomy&#9;&#9;boy&#9;age 3 1/2</P>
<P>Madame Celaine was very sweet and grateful for our visit. On first contact with a representative from St. Boniface, she had been very embarrassed that she did not have a chair to offer her guest. The house is about 8 feet by 8 feet with a dirt floor. The only furniture is one twin cot and a small table. All I could think of was that when the rainy season came, they could not all fit in the house at the same time. </P>
<P>The children gathered for a picture. Neighbors joined them. I could not tell who was who. The littlest ones wore only t-shirts because that was all they had. I brought some sheets and towels and a few articles of clothing. I was totally unprepared for what I found there. It was devastating. I felt ashamed of having brought so little. We have just begun sponsoring them. The first thing I did when I returned was to fill a large suitcase with clothes and send it with the next group. The family now has a goat and some chickens. We are purchasing a donkey to carry the water from the well 2-3 miles away. All water for drinking, cooking, and bathing must be carried this distance. They have traveled on foot up until now. They will also use the donkey to go to the outdoor market. </P>
<P>Through a local administrator, we have arranged to get them food and money on a regular basis. With so many mouths to feed, $125 will not go far. The older children are in school. One boy of 19 asked to go back because he had gone to school last year for the first time in his life. </P>
<P>What they need most right now is a new house. For about $1500, she can have a sturdy 1 or 2 room house built of cinder blocks. Anyone who can help with an extra donation for the house can send it to Saint Boniface Haiti Foundation c/o Rita Russo, 40 Pine Street, Norwood, Mass. 02062. I never expected to ask you for anything extra, but I cannot let them live like this. The yard is bare and dry without a blade of grass or vegetation. I felt the weight of the world on my heart when I saw this family. Please help if you can.</P>
<P>You are welcome to call me if you have any questions: Rita Russo (781) 762-4391.</P>
