From Gene Betit 8/12:<br>
Our next Water into Wine weekend is September 17 &amp; 18th.&nbsp; The
cost is<br>
$75; there are brochures in the back of church and opposite my office<br>
(Social Justice) in the Ministry Center.<br>
<br>
Beyond the weekend, everyone getting married in the Church needs to<br>
present a copy of their baptism certificates (obtained in the last six<br>
months).&nbsp; In this diocese, as in many others, one must get parents
to<br>
fill out Affidavits of Freedom to Marry (forms I will be glad to give<br>
you--two each, one for each of your parents), complete a Pre-Nuptial<br>
Investigation and FOCCUS Survey.<br>
<br>
Fr. Tuz can most likely help you in the priest department through the<br>
Holy Ghost Fathers world-wide web.&nbsp; You'll need to contact him
directly.<br>
